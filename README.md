# AFP_Cinemates
Project for an iOS (Swift) application for the Apple Formation program at Simplon in January-February 2025. It was made in 2 weeks. It's not a finished application, but rather a functional model. In it, I was labeled as 'apprenant 98'.

Cinemates is a fun and interactive app where we can effortlessly track, rate, and explore movies. We can organize our collection by creating personalized lists of films we’ve already seen or those we want to watch in the future. If we want to see what our friends or the communities we follow are into, we simply need to browse their curated movie lists or just stay updated with the latest additions they’ve added.
Looking for a movie but can’t decide what to watch? No problem! We can use the Randomizer feature to quickly generate a recommendation, and we can refine our search with customizable filters based on genres, ratings, or even years. The unique aspect comes from being able to make the suggestion based on either our personal watchlists or those of our friends or communities we follow. Whether we're in the mood for something familiar or looking to discover something new based on your social circle.
