# AFP_Cinemates
Project for an iOS (Swift) application for the Apple Formation program at Simplon in January-February 2025. It was made in 2 weeks. It's not a finished application, but rather a functional model. In it, I was labeled as Carine ESPEJO. It’s worth noting that our group was new to both coding and Swift/SwiftUI. We had only two weeks of training prior to this project, which were divided between project planning, mockups, UX/UI design, the basics of Swift (variables, loops, etc.), SwiftUI, and a brief introduction to object-oriented programming.

Cinemates is a fun and interactive app where we can effortlessly track, rate, and explore movies. We can organize our collection by creating personalized lists of films we’ve already seen or those we want to watch in the future. If we want to see what our friends or the communities we follow are into, we simply need to browse their curated movie lists or just stay updated with the latest additions they’ve added.
Looking for a movie but can’t decide what to watch? No problem! We can use the Randomizer feature to quickly generate a recommendation, and we can refine our search with customizable filters based on genres, ratings, or even years. The unique aspect comes from being able to make the suggestion based on either our personal watchlists or those of our friends or communities we follow. Whether we're in the mood for something familiar or looking to discover something new based on your social circle.

You can find my name in all the files where I contributed significantly or wrote substantial portions of code. For clarity, here is a list of the main tasks I was responsible for during this project:
  - Create a font extension file to implement and manage custom fonts.
 - Design and create the data models and set up the initial database structure.
 - Act as the central integration point by collecting and assembling all code on my machine
   (as requested by our teachers,we did not use GitHub).
- code the login page
- code the randomized page
- code the filmcell view (in CommonViews folder)
- code the rating pageView (in CommonViews folder)
- code the trailer view (in CommonViews folder)
- Integrated the trailer View into the FilmPageView
- Integrated the rating pageView into the togglenotationfilmview
